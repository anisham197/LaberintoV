# LaberintoV

Developed a complete solution for Indoor Maps and Positioning using WiFi Fingerprinting as part of our final year project at Ramaiah Institute of Technology. Consists of 4 user facing components:
1) LaberintoC - An android app for customers which displays indoor maps of buildings and their realtime position on it.  https://github.com/anisham197/LaberintoC
2) LaberintoV - An android app for admins to collect WiFi fingerprints at different locations in the building. These WiFi fingerprints are used to train a model using machine learning. The model is used to determine the position of a person inside a building. https://github.com/anisham197/LaberintoV
3) Indoor Maps - A web application which allows admins to upload indoor maps of buildings and add details of specific rooms and locations.  https://github.com/anisham197/IndoorMaps
4) ML model which is hosted on a server and trains on data as it is collected by the admins. https://github.com/aaasp18/ML and https://github.com/aaasp18/Serverless
